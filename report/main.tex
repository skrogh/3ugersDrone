\section{ Introduction }



\section{Hardware description}
Most of the hardware was contructed before the start of the course, mainly
because we needed a custom PCB fabricated and lead times for PCBs from China are
unpredictable and can be long.
Likewise a lot of 3D printing was needed for the frame, and this takes quite
some time (total printing time for the parts used was about 14h, then comes
part design, prototypes and printer setup).

\subsection{ Flight controller }
The main processor of the fligt controller is a \emph{Texas
Instruments} \emph{TM4C123GH6 tiva series ARM CORTEX M4F} processor.
This processor was chosen due to ease of use.
The chip is avaliable from most distributors and cheap development boards,
\emph{TI Launchpad}s, can be used as debuggers. Further more a huge driver
library (\emph{TivaWare}) for hardware abstraction is available from \emph{TI}s
webpage.

The flighcontroller has a varity of IO ports: PWM outputs, I2C, CAN, UART,
analog and digital inpus, a special port for conneting to the \emph{Hardkernel
oDroid U3} Linux computer via SPI, SPI connection for a radio module, and
onboard IMU (\emph{Invensense mpu9250}) and barometer (\emph{Freescale
MPL3115A2}).

A close-up of the populated fligtcontroller PCB can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:flightcontroller}. Note that not all IO modules are populated with the
needed parts. Some mistakes were made in the layout, and thus had to be fixed
(pink wire nest).

\subsection{ Radio }
We chose the \emph{TI CC1101} $433MHz$ radio module, as this was relativly easy
to get working.

For non-tethered telemetry a remote controller was contructed, capable of
sending low amounts of data between the flightcontroller and remote. The remote
has a USB port for dumping telemetry data to a PC and joystics for sending
steering commands to the flight controller.

A picture of the crude radio remote controller can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:remote}

\subsection{ Motors, ESCs, propellers }
Motors and motor drivers were bought from china. The \emph{EMAX MT1806} motors
and reccomended drivers for those were chosen due to good reviews from
hobbyists. Likewise 5030 carbonfiber propellers were chosen, as they are the
reccomended propellers for motors of this size.

\section{ System identification } %change title?
While the differential equations governing attitude are highly nonlinear,
they can be linearized about a working-point, where the angular speed is zero.
Thus the gyroscopic effects can be omitted.

The thrust of each motor is assumed to be linear with the control output and the
retardation can be modelled as a first order lowpass filter.

The differential equations for rotation arround the $x$ and $y$ axes
becomes:
\begin{equation}
 \dddiff\theta_x = \frac{1}{\tau_{motor}} \cdot \left(
 (u_1 + u_2 - u_3 - u_4) G_{thrust} l_{y} \frac{ 1 }{ I_{x} }  - \ddiff\theta_x
 \right) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \dddiff\theta_y = \frac{1}{\tau_{motor}} \cdot \left(
 (-u_1 + u_2 + u_3 - u_4) G_{thrust} l_{x} \frac{ 1 }{ I_{y} }  - \ddiff\theta_y
 \right) 
\end{equation}
Where $G_{thrust}$ is the thrust in $N$ produced by a single propeller at full
thrust, $l_{x}$ is the length from the center of mass to the motors along the
$x$-axis, $I_{y}$ is the moment of inertia arround the $y$-axis,
$\tau_{motor}$ is the time constant of the motor and $u_{[1;4]}$ are motor
commands for motor $[1;4]$ in the range $[0;1]$.

Local coordinate system for the drone, and motor numbering is chosen as shown in
figure \ref{fig:axis}
\stdfig{0.8}{axis}{Choise of local coordinate system and motor numbering for
drone}{fig:axis}

If we control the motors in tandem so:
\begin{align}
u_1 = & u_x - u_y + T\\
u_2 = & u_x + u_y + T\\
u_3 = & -u_x + u_y + T\\
u_4 = & -u_x - u_y + T\\
\end{align}
Where T is a general thrust command the equatinos simplify to:
\begin{equation}
 \dddiff\theta_x = \frac{1}{\tau_{motor}} \cdot \left(
 4 u_x G_{thrust} l_{y} \frac{ 1 }{ I_{x} }  - \ddiff\theta_x
 \right) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \dddiff\theta_y = \frac{1}{\tau_{motor}} \cdot \left(
4 u_y G_{thrust} l_{x} \frac{ 1 }{ I_{y} }  - \ddiff\theta_y
 \right) 
\end{equation}


\section{ Sensor filtering } %change title?
Since the rotating propellers introduce a lot of vibration some sort of
filtering is required. Clasically mechanical filters (foam and rubber-rings) has
been used as a solutuion to this problem. We propose using a high-samplerate
IMU and using a digital filter to supress vibration above the output rate of the
controller. Assuming that the plant dynamics are temporarily linear, we can
perform further state estimation on a downsampled version of the IMU- readings,
allowing for more complex estimators.

As an attitude estimator we use the popular \emph{Madgwick sensor fusion
algorithm}[http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/], which
fuses measuremenst form a 3-axis gyrope and 3-axis accelerometer. The gyro measuremens are integrated to find the attitude and the
accelerometer is used to compensate for gyro drift.

The angular acceleration can be estimating by nummerical differentiation of the
filtered gyro measurements.

\section{ Controller } %change title?

If the input to the attitude is the desired thrust vector, we can measure the
angular differences as shown in figure \ref{fig:controller}.

We denote this angle $\vec{\Delta\theta} = \matrix{c}{}{}{ \Delta \theta_x \\
\Delta\theta_y}$ and the angular rotation and angular acceleration
in the local coordinate system: $\vec\omega$ and $\vec\alpha$.

\stdfig{0.8}{controller}{Diagram showing how the difference in
current and desired angle is calculated}{fig:controller}

The controller for each axis is designed via pole placement, with state
limmitation, as in [Non-cascaded Dynamic Inversion Design for Quadrotor Position
Control with L1 Augmentation], but without the refference model.

The poles are placed to form a critically dampened $3^{rd}$ system, with tripple
pole in $\omega$, this system can be seen in figure \ref{fig:controller-no-fix}
where:
\begin{align}
k_0 & = \omega^3\\
k_1 & = 3\omega^2\\
k_2 & = 3\omega
\end{align}

\stdfig{0.8}{controller-no-fix}{Diagram for desired
system}{fig:controller-no-fix}

To hide the rotor dynamics, we introduce two new gains: $g_1$ and $g_2$ as seen
in figure \ref{fig:controller-fix}, where $G$ is the static gain of the system
given by max thrust, arm length etc.
This makes the rotor dynamics behave, as if the time constant was $\frac{1}{3\omega}$ instead of $\tau_{motor}$.
The gains $g_1$ and $g_2$ become:
\begin{align}
g_1 = k_2 \tau_{motor,est}
g_2 =1 - \frac{1}{g_1}
\end{align}

\stdfig{0.9}{controller-fix}{Diagram for controller
with state limmitation and system}{fig:controller-fix}

Since neither the true gain of the system, or the motor timeconstant are know
precisly, they must be estimated, $G_e$ and $\tau_{motor,est}$. However as long
as the estimated values are close to the real values, and $\tau_{motor,est} \geq
\tau_{moto}$ and $G_e \leq G$ - that is the system is not estimated to be
faster, than it acually is - the system is still stabile. %jeg har plots og

% analytisk%

The only tuning needed is changing $\omega$, $\omega$ must be low enough that
the phase shift introduced by the sensor filter is not an issue and low enough
for the output limmitation no to cause trouble. A value between $10$ and $25$
seemed good for our drone.

\section{ Results } %change title?

The drone was tethered to the legs of an up-side-down table, so it could only
roate arround the $y$-axis, for testing the attitude controller.

It became apparent during testing, that the mechanical vibration was so
powerfull, that the IMU sensors saturate, resulting in instability due to bad
state estimation. In figure \ref{fig:omegaNoDamp8k} the gyro measourements
arround the $y$-axis is plottet. It is very apparent that the measuremens clip
at $\pm2^15$ when thrust is increased at about 17s.

To fix this a quick mechanical filter of earbuds was implemented.

In \ref{fig:omegaDamp8k} the raw gyro measurements after the mechanical filter
can be seen. At about 90s the throttle is raised to the same level, that caused
clipping before.

While this did solve the vibration problem, it also created some problems.
Sensor allignment becomes difficout, as the wires to the fligcontroller pulls the
flightcontroller ascew. Furthermore the mechanical filter has not been
modelled, so it's effect on the system is not accouted for.
Angular acceleration also seemes to suffer from this filter, in figure
\ref{fig:alphaDamp} and \ref{fig:alphaNoDamp} the angular acceleleration
estimate, before the thrust is raised is clearly less noisy for the drone
without the mechanical filter.

$y$-axis with mechanical filter}{fig:alphaDamp}
\stdfignoscale{alphaNoDamp}{Angular acceleration arround the
$y$-axis with mechanical filter}{fig:alphaNoDamp}

However the anglular speed measurements clearly benefit from this filter as seen
in \ref{fig:omegaDamp} and \ref{fig:omegaNoDamp}

$y$-axis with mechanical filter}{fig:omegaDamp}
\stdfignoscale{omegaNoDamp}{Angular speed arround the
$y$-axis with mechanical filter}{fig:omegaNoDamp}

A fix for this could be better balancing of propellers, as cheap propellers are
often slightly unsymmetrical. Another solution would be to find a more
predictable alternative for the earbuds.

In figure \ref{fig:thetaDamp} we see the estimated rotation arround the
$y$-axis for the test with the mechanical filter. Zooming
(\ref{fig:thetaDampZoom}) in we can get a rough estimate of the bandwith of the
attitude controller. The input in this region is $[0^o, 45^o, -45^o, 0^o, 45^o,
0^o]$ and the rise time for the $45^o$ steps are roughly $1/3 s$ while the rise
time for the $90^o$ step is about $1/2 s$.
